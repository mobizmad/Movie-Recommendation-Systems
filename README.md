Overview
This project builds a Movie Recommendation System using three approaches:
1️⃣ Cosine Similarity – Measures similarity between movie descriptions.
2️⃣ TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) – Weighs important words for better recommendations.
3️⃣ Enhanced with Stop Words Removal – Filters out common words for improved accuracy.

Technologies Used
🔹 Python (NumPy, Pandas)
🔹 Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
🔹 NLP (Text Vectorization, Stop Words Removal)

Implementation
✅ 1. Cosine Similarity
Converts movie descriptions into vectors.
Computes similarity scores to find the closest matches.
✅ 2. TF-IDF (Weighted Similarity)
Assigns importance to words to improve recommendations.
✅ 3. Enhanced with Stop Words Removal
Removes common words to refine similarity calculations.
